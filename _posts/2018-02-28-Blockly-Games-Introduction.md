Blockly Games Introduction  28/02/18

In today's lesson we were told to login and then bring our chairs over to the board and we were introduced to website called blockly games and we went over basic instructions that we were supposed to use in the game.

After that we were sent back to our computers to try the game out for ourselves it seemed easy at first with simple moving codes but then it got harder.

I had to face problems like:

Simple code not working 

Paths not functioning

Not getting a small piece of code correct which could ruin the whole attempt to get to the finish line.

In the end you kind of get the hang of putting each kind of code into each place.

To improve my learning I think next time I could think more on my feet about how to overcome problems.

To overcome problems you would have to:

Add small bits of coding into one chunk of coding

Try to limit amount of blocks used 

Try to limit amount of time taken

In the future the changes I need to make are:

Take less time on easy stages

Take time trying to limit number of code blocks

Try to use repeat codes more often.
