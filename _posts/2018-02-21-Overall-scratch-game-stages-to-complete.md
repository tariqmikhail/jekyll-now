Overall Scratch Game Stages To Complete

To complete my game in scratch I went through different stages and problems on working and coding sprites and creating ideas for my game.

I went through problems like when a sprite is being programmed to do something but the coding you try to put in just doesn't work.

The stages I went through were first making simple sprites like a main character and obstacle courses which block you out and make the player have to restart the game.

Then I went through the stage of programming the main character of the game, this was when many of the small but slightly annoying problems took place and started to happen over the course of coding each sprite which leads me onto my next sprites which were the main obstacle courses and blockages which did have a few problems here and there but were mainly fine.

After those stages I started to add some backdrops of my choice I managed the backdrops pretty easily and got them finished quickly.

After that in a lesson we played each others games and judged them based on how well the game ran.

After that I was just adding more and more bits and bobs to my game to make it better.

The things that could have gone better in my game are: the time that it took to programme each sprite I think it took to long to programme certain parts and using a certain method I think it would have been much more quick and easy to code.

The things which I could have improved in my learning are: Use a quick and more easy method into what coding I am going to run also this means maybe I could have programmed the sprites in a different order than the one I used.
